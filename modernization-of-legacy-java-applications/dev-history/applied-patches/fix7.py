# fix7.py - archived one-off patch script, inert now (old dev path,
# C:\dev\..., no longer exists). This is a big one historically: it's
# the patch that split the old single "apply_known_migration_fixes"
# function into the generic/project-specific split orchestrator.py still
# uses today - apply_generic_migration_fixes() for fixes that should work
# on any Spring Boot 2 -> 3 app, and apply_project_specific_fixes() for
# the handful of fixes that only make sense for spring-petclinic-rest's
# exact file layout. Back when this patch was written, a temporary
# apply_known_migration_fixes() wrapper was kept around too, just calling
# both in sequence, so nothing else had to change right away - that
# wrapper doesn't exist in the current orchestrator.py anymore, since the
# call sites were later updated to call the two functions directly.
