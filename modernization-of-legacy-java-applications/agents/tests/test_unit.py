"""
Unit tests for the pure, deterministic logic underlying the pipeline's
evidence reporting, remediation targeting, and dashboard input validation.

These deliberately avoid anything that calls the LLM or runs Maven - that
behaviour is exercised empirically instead, by running the full pipeline
against real applications (see Chapter 5, Sections 5.4 and 5.5). What's
tested here is the logic that turns raw scan/build output into the numbers
and decisions the dissertation reports.

Run with:  python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
