# app.py - web backend for the Modernization Control Panel dashboard
#
# This is the server-side component that powers the dashboard UI. It's intentionally
# lightweight - no database, no ORM, just a Flask app that reads files from the
# filesystem and serves them up to the frontend. The pipeline runs (orchestrator.py)
# write their output to evaluation/<app_id>/ and this reads those results.
#
# The dashboard shows:
#   - Which apps have successfully completed a pipeline run
#   - The detailed stage-by-stage log for each app
#   - Before/after metrics: CVEs, test counts, and coverage percentages
#
# Routes:
#   /              - the dashboard HTML page
#   /apps          - JSON list of available apps (clean runs vs incomplete)
#   /status/<id>   - JSON pipeline stage log for a specific app
#   /report/<id>   - JSON before/after metrics for a specific app
#   /download/<id>/<kind> - download a zip of the app's code or report
#                    (kind is one of "old-code", "new-code", "report")
